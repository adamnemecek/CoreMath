# Math

(Simple) Mathematical operations, as well as some some techniques that Swift offers, are shown here.

## Matrices

The cross product of any two matrices with the same type (e.g. both being of type [[Double]] or both being of type [[Int]]) is implemented with an infix operator *.

The scalar product is also implemented by using the infix operator *. It multiplies a matrix and one single value with the same type (e.g. [[Double]] and Double, [[Int]] and Int, etc).

These calculations can also be printed out as LaTeX code, so that it can be used in e.g. a paper.
